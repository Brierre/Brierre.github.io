										<h3>What's new? July 30, 2024</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Another day, another few projects. Recently, I have survived my 6th year of writing the marching 
										band drill/routine and teaching the 2024 show at band camp. One of my biggest work-joys is working 
										alongside my sister, Ashley, to direct her school's marching band. She has been a force to be 
										reckoned with at that school district, and thanks to her 24/7 dedication as a teacher, the 
										program is getting better and better every year. This is 100% due to her hard work, spending 
										every waking moment at the school and making sure everything gets done. In any case, our show, 
										"The Hills Are Alive" will feature music from "The Sound of Music" and it came out great. Now it 
										comes down to the students putting in individual practice time on their music to make it great.
									</p>
									<p>
										My boys are both graduated. One just received his bachelor's degree in computer science and is 
										having a hard time adjusting to the real world. The other is headed off to West Chester University 
										in a month. I'm not sure what that means for me. I know, though, that I don't want to lose myself 
										in my job--I want to travel and go out and enjoy life, not spend every minute at school making up 
										for circumstances beyond my control. Don't get me wrong, I love my job, and I am going to take 
										the next couple of years to focus on my professional development. I am taking classes now that 
										will help me address some areas where I feel I have shortcomings as a vocal teacher. I have given 
										up the post of musical director (as much as I loved directing the pit orchestra) and plan to start 
										work on my master's degree this school year. I just know that I want some work-life balance that I 
										didn't get last year.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the programming sphere, I am trying to build an application for music educators as a search 
										tool for jazz charts. I feel so rusty, and I want to go back and retake my boot camps to feel more 
										confident in my skills, but I also know that by just doing it, I will remember a lot. My current 
										class is called "Jazzing Up Your Classroom" and this is kind of an alternate take on the third 
										project required for the class. In my signature style, I like to think of an application that 
										people will actually be able to use. I know that's the point, but when you're learning, the 
										projects tend to be less useful in an effort to just teach the skills using something simple. 
										Hopefully, I can finish this and post it online where my teacher can see it and use it, and its 
										unconventional project medium will be fine. I feel like that would be better than creating a unit 
										that I may or may not ever actually use.

									<p>
										Music teachers are always macro-planning far in advance, while also micro-planning what is 
										in the now. As the school year winds down, I find myself trying to think ahead to my summer 
										learning as I write program notes and put the finishing touches on the concert(s) at hand. 
										Musical season has ended and our run was well done, despite a really long and grueling prep. 
										We are heading to the local theatre awards next week, and then I am finished with that chapter 
										of my life for now. 
									</p>
									<p>
										On the home front, things are exciting. I have not one, but <i>two</i> graduating seniors 
										this year. My older son is finishing up his coursework for a degree in Comp Sci from Lock 
										Haven University, and my younger son is about to graduate from high school. I hope to be able 
										to create web applications with my older son in the future, as his knowledge of programming 
										fills in the gaps in my knowledge. Over the last four years, we have helped each other get 
										past the imposter syndrome that comes along with learning to develop programs. I look forward 
										to being adults together with these two. My younger son wants to attend college closer to his 
										dad and that fills me with a little bit of mom-dread, thinking that he won't be right here 
										with me for the foreseeable future, but he and his dad are close, and I can't be happier that 
										they will get to spend more time together.
									</p>
									<p>
										As for programming, my current project is to satisfy a couple of goals. I haven't written any 
										new apps in several months, since the school year began. In order to get back in the swing of 
										things, and in order to satisfy a requirement for a jazz graduate course I am taking, I will be 
										creating an application similar to the final projects for boot camp using React and Vite. I have 
										begun the process of coding during my lunches, but I can't wait to get home where I have no 
										limitations on the network that do not allow me to see my work. I'll be figuring out how to host 
										the project this time, bypassing mock apis.

									<p>
										Things are definitely crazy in the life of this choir director/musical director/marching 
										band director/mom. I keep thinking (or maybe it's just hoping) that there will be a break 
										at some point some day. Right now, I'm three weeks out from our musical, which is Damn 
										Yankees this year. I may have bitten off more than I can chew with this one, but what's 
										a little sheer panic among friends, right?
									</p>
									<p>
										Software development just has to wait when every spare moment is eaten up by sewing twelve 
										pairs of vintage-style baseball pants and creating 24 baseball jerseys with a Cricut and a 
										heat press--and that's just the costuming part of things. I know these kids and I know 
										myself and my stage director, Michele (who is awesome!) and I'm positive we will pull this 
										off and it will be great, but the sheer panic thing is real!
									</p>
									<p>	I have been thinking about developing lately, however, and my plans are to finish a C++ 
										course that I purchased several years ago, and put aside because I felt a little overwhelmed 
										by pointers. I purchased a refurbished macbook a couple of weeks ago, so I can see what the 
										buzz is all about with those. I'm ready for the break in musical activities--you know, those 
										two days in between when musical season ends and marching band season starts once again--so 
										I can get some things set up and get working on that class. I also plan to brush up on my 
										boot camp stuff since I feel like I forget everything already. And finally, I want to get 
										this website moving along a little bit. It has been stagnant, and though it is just a 
										template-based site, I really hate the idea of having lorem ipsum on my pages. I didn't come 
										up with that myself. :D

									<p>
										I'm now about 2/3 of the way through Promineo Tech Front End Software Development Boot 
										Camp, and I am astonished at how much I've learned. I find myself immensely enjoying 
										putting together websites using new (to me) technologies and skills. Right now, we are 
										getting into React, which is something we will be able to use in the real world. It's 
										been around awhile, but it isn't imminently going out of date like some of the other 
										tools we have been using to learn the ropes.
									</p>
									<p>
										We are going into the final project season for class and it is going to be tough. I'm 
										excited to work on my project--it's either going to be a Warhammer 40k Army Builder or a 
										Disc Golf Scorekeeping and Course Notes app. However, it is due the week after band camp, 
										and as you may have seen from another part of my page, I am one of our band directors, and 
										I also write the show. I am on the hook to write the drill and the band front routine this 
										week and have to somehow squeeze in coding homework around that. Then I have to teach it 
										during long days at band camp. I hate to be late, so I will probably find a way to get my 
										homework done on time somehow, I just haven't figured out how that will be yet. Divine 
										intervention may be needed.

									<p>
										I spent this week taking short classes online in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to prepare 
										for my Front End Developer Boot Camp through Promineo Tech and Gateway Community 
										College in Arizona. I'll be studying several weeks concentrating on each language, but 
										I had the time to take these mini courses through a site called GreatLearning, and 
										they've been quite helpful. I'm looking forward to writing code in the front end program. 
										After having finished their Back End Boot Camp, I was impressed by the community at 
										Promineo Tech and wanted to go full stack.
									</p>
									<p>
										My first boot camp was also through Promineo Tech, only the school was the Community 
										College of Philadelphia, and it is pretty incredible just how much information I 
										crammed into 18 weeks. I went from having faked my way through some Lua code a couple 
										of years ago (written for a private FFXI open-source project) and having no idea what 
										I was doing, to writing an entire REST application from scratch, using our homework 
										and several other students' projects as models. I chose Gateway Community College this 
										time around because 1.) I LOVE the desert. It's my happy place, and 2.) The only time 
										I can take a class on Thursdays this semester is after 9pm, so the PST of Arizona this 
										time of year worked out perfectly. I'm one of those people who believes in signs and 
										to some extent, destiny. Arizona is definitely calling my name here!
									</p>
									<p>
										When I began the back end boot camp, I had no intentions of looking for work in the field 
										of software development, I simply wanted to learn to do a new skill the right way. Now 
										that I have been able to create things and have seen the fruits of my labor, I am 
										not entirely ruling out a career change. My current job is teaching choir, musical theatre, 
										and general music in grades 6-12. I love my students and I love teaching music, so I'm not 
										ready to jump in with both feet yet.

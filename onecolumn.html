										<h3>What's new? February 24, 2024</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Things are definitely crazy in the life of this choir director/musical director/marching 
										band director/mom. I keep thinking (or maybe it's just hoping) that there will be a break 
										at some point some day. Right now, I'm three weeks out from our musical, which is Damn 
										Yankees this year. I may have bitten off more than I can chew with this one, but what's 
										a little sheer panic among friends, right?
									</p>
									<p>
										Software development just has to wait when every spare moment is eaten up by sewing twelve 
										pairs of vintage-style baseball pants and creating 24 baseball jerseys with a Cricut and a 
										heat press--and that's just the costuming part of things. I know these kids and I know 
										myself and my stage director, Michele (who is awesome!) and I'm positive we will pull this 
										off and it will be great, but the sheer panic thing is real!
									</p>
									<p>	I have been thinking about developing lately, however, and my plans are to finish a C++ 
										course that I purchased several years ago, and put aside because I felt a little overwhelmed 
										by pointers. I purchased a refurbished macbook a couple of weeks ago, so I can see what the 
										buzz is all about with those. I'm ready for the break in musical activities--you know, those 
										two days in between when musical season ends and marching band season starts once again--so 
										I can get some things set up and get working on that class. I also plan to brush up on my 
										boot camp stuff since I feel like I forget everything already. And finally, I want to get 
										this website moving along a little bit. It has been stagnant, and though it is just a 
										template-based site, I really hate the idea of having lorem ipsum on my pages. I didn't come 
										up with that myself. :D

										<h3>What's new? July 10, 2023</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I'm now about 2/3 of the way through Promineo Tech Front End Software Development Boot 
										Camp, and I am astonished at how much I've learned. I find myself immensely enjoying 
										putting together websites using new (to me) technologies and skills. Right now, we are 
										getting into React, which is something we will be able to use in the real world. It's 
										been around awhile, but it isn't imminently going out of date like some of the other 
										tools we have been using to learn the ropes.
									</p>
									<p>
										We are going into the final project season for class and it is going to be tough. I'm 
										excited to work on my project--it's either going to be a Warhammer 40k Army Builder or a 
										Disc Golf Scorekeeping and Course Notes app. However, it is due the week after band camp, 
										and as you may have seen from another part of my page, I am one of our band directors, and 
										I also write the show. I am on the hook to write the drill and the band front routine this 
										week and have to somehow squeeze in coding homework around that. Then I have to teach it 
										during long days at band camp. I hate to be late, so I will probably find a way to get my 
										homework done on time somehow, I just haven't figured out how that will be yet. Divine 
										intervention may be needed.

										<h3>What's new? April 8, 2023</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I spent this week taking short classes online in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to prepare 
										for my Front End Developer Boot Camp through Promineo Tech and Gateway Community 
										College in Arizona. I'll be studying several weeks concentrating on each language, but 
										I had the time to take these mini courses through a site called GreatLearning, and 
										they've been quite helpful. I'm looking forward to writing code in the front end program. 
										After having finished their Back End Boot Camp, I was impressed by the community at 
										Promineo Tech and wanted to go full stack.
									</p>
									<p>
										My first boot camp was also through Promineo Tech, only the school was the Community 
										College of Philadelphia, and it is pretty incredible just how much information I 
										crammed into 18 weeks. I went from having faked my way through some Lua code a couple 
										of years ago (written for a private FFXI open-source project) and having no idea what 
										I was doing, to writing an entire REST application from scratch, using our homework 
										and several other students' projects as models. I chose Gateway Community College this 
										time around because 1.) I LOVE the desert. It's my happy place, and 2.) The only time 
										I can take a class on Thursdays this semester is after 9pm, so the PST of Arizona this 
										time of year worked out perfectly. I'm one of those people who believes in signs and 
										to some extent, destiny. Arizona is definitely calling my name here!
									</p>
									<p>
										When I began the back end boot camp, I had no intentions of looking for work in the field 
										of software development, I simply wanted to learn to do a new skill the right way. Now 
										that I have been able to create things and have seen the fruits of my labor, I am 
										not entirely ruling out a career change. My current job is teaching choir, musical theatre, 
										and general music in grades 6-12. I love my students and I love teaching music, so I'm not 
										ready to jump in with both feet yet.
